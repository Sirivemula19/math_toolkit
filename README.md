# Math Toolkit â€” Web Application

An **interactive math utility web app** built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The app provides a wide range of number-theoretic and combinatorial operations accessible from a clean sidebar menu.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Multiple Operations in One Place**
  - GCD / HCF of integers
  - LCM of integers
  - Prime number check
  - Factorization of integers
  - Factorial (n!)
  - Combinations (nCr) & Permutations (nPr)
  - Power function (b^e)
  - Fibonacci sequence (n-th number)
  - Sum of digits
  - Reverse digits
  - Fraction simplification
  - LCM of a range
- **Responsive Design** â€” works on desktops and mobile devices.
- **BigInt Support** â€” handles very large integers.
- **Searchable Sidebar** â€” quickly filter and choose operations.



## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for modern, responsive design
